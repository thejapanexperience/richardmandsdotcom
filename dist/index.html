I'm a full-stack javascript developer. Working predominantly with a MERN Stack, I have experience implementing React, React Native, jQuery, Redux, Flux, Node, Express, Mongo, Firebase, Amazon Web Services, GoogleAPIs and more into my apps. I'm strongly self-reliant and am able to quickly learn and incorporate new technologies into my projects.

I was part of the team that won the Cisco developer prize at the Lady Problems hackathon in San Francisco in October 2016 for creating Entable - an sms-based online banking platform for use in developing countries."><meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1"><link href="/main.490a0868874fa41c5b818a7d8522e825.css" rel="stylesheet"></head><body><div id="app"></div><script type="text/javascript" src="/main.9883478195c689162204.js"></script></body></html>
