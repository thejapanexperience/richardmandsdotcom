I'm a full-stack javascript developer. Working predominantly with a MERN Stack, I have experience implementing React, React Native, jQuery, Redux, Flux, Node, Express, Mongo, Firebase, Amazon Web Services, GoogleAPIs and more into my apps. I'm strongly self-reliant and am able to quickly learn and incorporate new technologies into my projects.
    I am the co-founder / lead developer of Eduku. See my portfolio for details.
    I was part of the team that won the Cisco developer prize at the Lady Problems hackathon in San Francisco in October 2016 for creating Entable - an sms-based online banking platform for use in developing countries."> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <link rel="stylesheet" href="/App.ce25a5c1.css"></head> <body> <div id="app"></div> <script src="/App.465181aa.js"></script> </body> </html>
