It is a good idea to use\n   * string constants for action types.\n   *\n   * @returns {Object} For convenience, the same action object you dispatched.\n   *\n   * Note that, if you use a custom middleware, it may wrap `dispatch()` to\n   * return something else (for example, a Promise you can await).\n   */\n  function dispatch(action) {\n    if (!isPlainObject(action)) {\n      throw new Error('Actions must be plain objects.
