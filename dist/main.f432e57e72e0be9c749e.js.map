Eduku is a social enterprise (self-funded charity), that uses profits from the sales of learning resources to fund educational opportunities (predominantly in low-income countries) for those who don\\'t have regular or sufficient access. We are creating a platform that will allow users to interact with well designed learning resources in the form of worksheets and online games for primary-age students, as well as participate in the allocation of funds raised by / through Eduku.
